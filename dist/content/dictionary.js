/* NOTES ON USE
---------------------
This is the main dictionary of site content. It is not actively rendered, but rather a pool of keys and values that
the site code can choose from. Adding new content here will do nothing without an associated change in the code to read
the new key created. The site content gets its values by referencing the keys here, so changing a key in this dictionary will break
that reference. The only things that can be updated in this file that will be reflected in the site automatically are the values.

Most key value pairs are self explanatory. Ideally the keys are named and organized in a manner where it is clear what
part of the site is referencing that key.

3 unique dictionary structures are links, in_line_links and pages:

LINKS: offer two property values to change - the text of the link and the link url.

IN_LINE_LINKS: For cases when you want a line of text to include a link, the text is specified by the text property and
an in_line_link object specifies which section of text should be rendered as the link with a url. The in_line_link text
should match exactly the section of the original text that will be rendered as a link.
Example:
{
  text: 'The full text, including some text that will be rendered as the link',
  in_line_link: {
    text: 'the link',
    link: 'www.someUrl.com'
  }
}

PAGES: offer the title of the page (which determines their name in the header and footer components) and the relative path.
Changing the path will just change what the user sees in the URL when navigating to that page. This was done just in case
the page title is changed and the site wants the URL to reflect that change as well.

Any changes to this or any of the content files have to respect Javascript object notation.
